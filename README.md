This one-day online workshop follows a 10x Genomics Visium spatial transcriptomics experiment from sequencing data to visualization. The primary packages used for analysis will be 10x software for sequence reads to counts, and the R package Seurat for downstream analysis. Course materials assume familiarity with single cell RNA-Seq experiments, the command line, and R.

Participants will need access to a computer with a reliable connection to the internet, a current versions of [R version](https://cloud.r-project.org/) and [Rstudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) installed, and an application that allows them to ssh into a server.
